## 1. The Problem

### What Your Clients Are Saying

> "I have all this customer data in inDigital, but I can't get insights from it."

> "I need to export to Excel every time I want to analyze something."

> "My team spends hours creating manual reports."

> "I wish I could just ask a question and get an answer."

### The Gap in Your Product

| What Clients Need | What inDigital Has Today |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| AI-powered insights | Basic reporting |
| Natural language queries | SQL knowledge required |
| Beautiful dashboards | Data exports |
| Automated reports | Manual processes |
| Predictive analytics | Historical data only |

### The Business Impact

- **Churn risk**: Clients leaving for platforms with better analytics
- **Lost deals**: Prospects choosing competitors with BI features
- **Support burden**: Manual report requests consuming your team's time
- **Missed upsell**: No premium tier to offer data-hungry clients
